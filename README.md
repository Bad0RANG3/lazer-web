# Lazer / Nextgen — Official Website

Static official site for Lazer, built with Vite and deployed on Vercel. No framework runtime dependency.

## Preview

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Production build:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Languages

The site ships with four languages:

- 简体中文 (`zh-CN`, default)
- 繁體中文 (`zh-Hant`)
- 日本語 (`ja`)
- English (`en`)

Use the language menu in the header. The selection is saved in `localStorage`, reflected in `<html lang>` and the document title/description, and can be shared with a query parameter:

```text
/?lang=zh-Hant
/?lang=ja
/?lang=en
```

All translations live in `assets/js/i18n.js`. Chinese source strings stay in `index.html`, and the runtime layer swaps them using the dictionaries in that file.

## Plugin market

`/plugin` is the plugin marketplace page. Lazer clients read `/plugin/plugins.json` as the market manifest; the same manifest powers the page's search, type filters, and plugin cards. Listings are PR-based — open-source plugins must include a public repository link, while closed-source plugins must submit a PR for every release. See [`plugin/README.md`](plugin/README.md) for the listing rules and field reference.

## Vercel deployment

`package.json` pins Vite as a dev dependency, and `vercel.json` sets the build command to `npm run build` with `dist` as the output directory. This fixes `sh: vite: command not found` during `vercel build`: the previous setup had a Vite build command but no local Vite binary to run it.

`Previous build caches not available` is informational — it only means the build started without a restored cache. The actual failure was the missing `vite` executable.

If the Vercel project was previously configured with Framework Preset `Vite`, keep Build Command as `npm run build` and Output Directory as `dist`.

## Design constraints

- Responsive layout: a `1240px` desktop content column; tablet and phone layouts reflow at `1180px`, `900px`, and `640px`.
- Cassette-case visual language: liner-note indexing, tracklist rows, J-card labels, and A/B side naming.
- Square UI geometry by default. The only rounded forms are the brand mark and status dots.
- Long-form content is the visual subject; there is no raster hero artwork, product screenshot gallery, floating card, or scroll-triggered effect.
- Motion: UI transitions use short hover/focus states. The full-bleed hero background combines spectral drift, traveling highlights, chrome glints, and a glass-case sheen; all decorative animation stops when reduced motion is requested.
- Palette: warm paper, near-black surfaces, and Apple Music-derived signal red. No blue-purple theme.
- Typography: locally subset MiSans in WOFF2 for consistent Chinese/Latin rendering.

## Hero artwork

The hero is a full-bleed animated CD refraction background built from inline SVG/CSS: a metallic U-frame, vertical rails, segmented silver panels, spectral arcs and a translucent disc case. It extends to the viewport edges without a framed card and uses no raster base image, JavaScript, or external rendering dependency.

The artwork lives in the `<aside class="hero-art hero-art-cd" data-slot="hero-art">` block in `index.html`; its absolute background positioning, responsive composition, and animations are in `assets/css/site.css`. Traveling light pulses follow the spectrum and chrome, while a sheen crosses the glass case. SVG titles provide accessible descriptions, and all decorative animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
